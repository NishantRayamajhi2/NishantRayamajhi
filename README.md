**Algorithm: Find Highest and Lowest Marks**

Step 1: Initialize highestMark in the list
Step 2: Initialize lowestMark in the list
Step 3: For each mark in the list:
   a. If the mark is greater than highestMark, update highestMark
   b. If the mark is less than lowestMark, update lowestMark
Step 4: Print highestMark and lowestMark as the results

**Algorithm: Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**

Step 1: Initialize total equal to 0
Step 2: For each mark in the list:
   a. Add the mark to total
Step 3: Calculate the mean by dividing total by the number of marks
Step 4: Initialize sumOfSquares equal to 0
Step 5: For each mark in the list:
   a. Subtract the mean from the mark and square the result
   b. Add the squared value to sumOfSquares
Step 6: Calculate the standard deviation as the square root of (sumOfSquares divided by the number of marks)
Step 7: Print mean and standard deviation as the results.
